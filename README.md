# homebridge-doorbird

`homebridge-doorbird` is a plugin for Homebridge.  Giving you an integrated experience with your [Doorbird](https://www.doorbird.com) door station.

It provides the HomeKit video doorbell service which includes a camera, lock, motion sensor, and infrared light service, using the excellent [homebridge-camera-ffmpeg](https://github/KhaosT/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg) as a foundation.

## Requirements and Limitations
* Audio requires an installation of [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) that is compiled with `fdk-aac` support. This plugin uses [ffmpeg-for-homebridge](https://github.com/homebridge/ffmpeg-for-homebridge) to streamline this for some of the more common operating systems. Check the `ffmpeg-for-homebridge` for details on supported operating systems. If your operating system isn't support, you'll need to compile your own. Instructions are beyond the scope of this plugin.

* Two-way audio is not currently supported. Currently, you can hear audio but the microphone capability is yet to be implemented.

* Additional relays and digital inputs are not currently exposed in this plugin, though you can trigger alternative relays (see below).

## Installation

If you are new to Homebridge, please first read the Homebridge [documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge).

1. Install Homebridge:
```sh
sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm homebridge
```

2. Install homebridge-doorbird:
```sh
sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm homebridge-doorbird
```

## Plugin configuration
Add the platform in `config.json` in your home directory inside `.homebridge` and edit the required fields. If you want audio support, make sure to set `audio` to `true`.

```js
"platforms": [
  {
    "platform": "DoorBird",
    "name": "Doorbird",

    "controllers": [
      {
        "doorbird": "your.doorbird.ip",
        "username": "some-doorbird-user (or create a new one just for homebridge)",
        "password": "some-doorbird-password",
        "audio": "true"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Doorbird notification configuration
In order for the plugin to receive notifications from Doorbird, you need to configure the Doorbird to notify `homebridge-doorbird`.

* Doorbell notifications
```sh
wget -q 'http://doorbird-ip/bha-api/notification.cgi?http-user=XXX&http-password=XXX&event=doorbell&subscribe=1&url=http://homebridge-ip:5005/doorbell.html'
```

* Motion sensor notifications
```sh
wget -q 'http://doorbird-ip/bha-api/notification.cgi?http-user=XXX&http-password=XXX&event=motionsensor&subscribe=1&url=http://homebridge-ip:5005/motion.html'
```

You can check your API registrations inside the DoorBird app itself, under Administration > HTTP Calls.

Additionally, if you would like to configure command line scripts or commands to execute when motion or doorbell events are triggered, you can configure the `cmdDoorbell` and `cmdMotion`, respectively.

* Relays and peripheral devices

The default relay for this plugin is to lock or unlock the first relay in the Doorbird. This is typically a door strike that unlocks a gate or door.

However, there is support for multiple relays available on some Doorbird devices and on the following optionally attached peripheral devices:

* A1081 E/A Controller (https://www.doorbird.com/downloads/manual_a1081_en_de.pdf) - TESTED
* A1101 Indoor Station (https://www.doorbird.com/downloads/datasheet/datasheet_a1101_en.pdf) - UNTESTED

You may switch the lock functionality to any of the relays on Doorbird devices or peripherals using the `relay` configuration parameter.

Example configuration for an alternate relay:
```js
"relay": "2"
```

Example configuration for peripheral device:
```js
"peripheral": "gggggg",
"peripheralRelay": "1",
```

The name of the controller or station can be found in the App: 
Administration > Peripherals > Device (6-letter word)

## Advanced configuration (optional)
This step is not required. For those that prefer to tailor the defaults to their liking, here are the supported parameters.
